Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using GPT-4.1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou are an agent - you must keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. ONLY terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved, or you absolutely cannot continue.\nYou take action when possible- the user is expecting YOU to take action and go to work for them. Don't ask unnecessary questions about the details if you can simply DO something useful instead.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. If you are stuck, you can fall back on the insert_edit_into_file tool, but apply_patch is much faster and is the preferred tool.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

              "This behavior is likely because your environment is missing the required array interface support libraries for Pygame, such as NumPy or the Python array module. In Pygame, functions like `pygame.surfarray` and `pygame.pixelarray` rely on these libraries to convert surface pixel data to and from arrays. If these libraries are not available or not properly installed, the related functions will silently become no-ops or return empty/default data, rather than raising errors.\n\nAdditionally, if Pygame was built or installed in a minimal/offline mode (as your folder name suggests), it may have been compiled without support for these array interfaces, or the dependencies were intentionally omitted to reduce package size or avoid external requirements.\n\nIn summary, the \"no-op\" behavior is almost always due to:\n- Missing NumPy or array module at runtime.\n- Pygame built without array support.\n- Running in an environment where these dependencies are not available.\n\nYou can confirm this by checking if importing `pygame.surfarray` or `pygame.pixelarray` raises an ImportError, or by checking the documentation for your specific Pygame build."

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2.

Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more.

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline.

You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline. Anything that's supposed to give me pixel data as arrays, or let me push array data back onto a surface, kind of behaves like a no-op. Can you explain why this is happening without changing anything?\n</userRequest>\n"

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress.

The tests may assume a C extension or a compiled version, but in normal Pygame, these functions might be provided through the C-extensions from the pygame.surfarray module. Here, they are intentionally stubs to avoid a runtime dependency on Pygame's C extension. The code imports pixelcopy functions, but the wrappers are not implemented. I should point out that the returns from functions like blit_array are None and suggest checking the upstream Pygame for a full implementation if needed.**Updating the to-do list**\n\nI need to update the to-do list to mark task 2 as completed and task 3 as in progress. Earlier, we set task 2 to in progress, so now I'll use the manage_todo_list tool to update their statuses. The tool requires the full list when I write, so I'll set task 2 to completed and task 3 to in progress. I'll include a note like, \"Mark search done and next step to inspect files,\" before calling the tool to submit the changes."

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done. Do not batch completions.",

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more.

                        "text": "**Explaining function stubs**\n\nThis file has unimplemented functions that return None. The tests may assume a C extension or a compiled version, but in normal Pygame, these functions might be provided through the C-extensions from the pygame.surfarray module. Here, they are intentionally stubs to avoid a runtime dependency on Pygame's C extension. The code imports pixelcopy functions, but the wrappers are not implemented. I should point out that the returns from functions like blit_array are None and suggest checking the upstream Pygame for a full implementation if needed.**Updating the to-do list**\n\nI need to update the to-do list to mark task 2 as completed and task 3 as in progress. Earlier, we set task 2 to in progress, so now I'll use the manage_todo_list tool to update their statuses. The tool requires the full list when I write, so I'll set task 2 to completed and task 3 to in progress. I'll include a note like, \"Mark search done and next step to inspect files,\" before calling the tool to submit the changes.",

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2.

Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress.

The tests may assume a C extension or a compiled version, but in normal Pygame, these functions might be provided through the C-extensions from the pygame.surfarray module. Here, they are intentionally stubs to avoid a runtime dependency on Pygame's C extension. The code imports pixelcopy functions, but the wrappers are not implemented. I should point out that the returns from functions like blit_array are None and suggest checking the upstream Pygame for a full implementation if needed.**Updating the to-do list**\n\nI need to update the to-do list to mark task 2 as completed and task 3 as in progress. Earlier, we set task 2 to in progress, so now I'll use the manage_todo_list tool to update their statuses. The tool requires the full list when I write, so I'll set task 2 to completed and task 3 to in progress. I'll include a note like, \"Mark search done and next step to inspect files,\" before calling the tool to submit the changes.",

This tool provides authoritative documentation for VS Code's extensive API surface, including proposed APIs, contribution points, and best practices. Use this tool for understanding complex VS Code API interactions.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- User asks about specific VS Code APIs, interfaces, or extension capabilities\n- Need documentation for VS Code extension contribution points (commands, views, settings, etc.)\n- Questions about proposed APIs and their usage patterns\n- Understanding VS Code extension lifecycle, activation events, and packaging\n- Best practices for VS Code extension development architecture\n- API examples and code patterns for extension features\n- Troubleshooting extension-specific issues or API limitations\n\nWhen NOT to use this tool:\n- Creating simple standalone files or scripts unrelated to VS Code extensions\n- General programming questions not specific to VS Code extension development\n- Questions about using VS Code as an editor (user-facing features)\n- Non-extension related development tasks\n- File creation or editing that doesn't involve VS Code extension APIs\n\nCRITICAL usage guidelines:\n1. Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5. Be specific about the VS Code version or API version when known\n\nScope: This tool is for EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT ONLY - building tools that extend VS Code itself, not for general file creation or non-extension programming tasks.",

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline. Anything that's supposed to give me pixel data as arrays, or let me push array data back onto a surface, kind of behaves like a no-op. Can you explain why this is happening without changing anything?\n</userRequest>\n"

This module\nwill only be functional when pygame can use the external NumPy package.\nIf NumPy can't be imported, surfarray becomes a MissingModule object.\n\nEvery pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,\ngreen, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a\ncolormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place\nthree or four values into a single number.\n\nThe arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y\naxis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to\nas 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue\ncolor values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred\nto as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for\nblue.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nfrom pygame.pixelcopy import (\n    array_to_surface,\n    surface_to_array,\n    map_array as pix_map_array,\n    make_surface as pix_make_surface,\n)\nimport numpy\nfrom numpy import (\n    array as numpy_array,\n    empty as numpy_empty,\n    uint32 as numpy_uint32,\n    ndarray as numpy_ndarray,\n)\n\nimport warnings  # will be removed in the future\n\n\n# float96 not available on all numpy versions.\nnumpy_floats = []\nfor type_name in \"float32 float64 float96\".split():\n    if hasattr(numpy, type_name):\n        numpy_floats.append(getattr(numpy, type_name))\n# Added below due to deprecation of numpy.float.

                        "text": "**Explaining function stubs**\n\nThis file has unimplemented functions that return None. The tests may assume a C extension or a compiled version, but in normal Pygame, these functions might be provided through the C-extensions from the pygame.surfarray module. Here, they are intentionally stubs to avoid a runtime dependency on Pygame's C extension. The code imports pixelcopy functions, but the wrappers are not implemented. I should point out that the returns from functions like blit_array are None and suggest checking the upstream Pygame for a full implementation if needed.**Updating the to-do list**\n\nI need to update the to-do list to mark task 2 as completed and task 3 as in progress. Earlier, we set task 2 to in progress, so now I'll use the manage_todo_list tool to update their statuses. The tool requires the full list when I write, so I'll set task 2 to completed and task 3 to in progress. I'll include a note like, \"Mark search done and next step to inspect files,\" before calling the tool to submit the changes.",

            "message": [
              "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done. Do not batch completions.",

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nYour name is GitHub Copilot. When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

            "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!"

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!",

This tool provides authoritative documentation for VS Code's extensive API surface, including proposed APIs, contribution points, and best practices. Use this tool for understanding complex VS Code API interactions.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- User asks about specific VS Code APIs, interfaces, or extension capabilities\n- Need documentation for VS Code extension contribution points (commands, views, settings, etc.)\n- Questions about proposed APIs and their usage patterns\n- Understanding VS Code extension lifecycle, activation events, and packaging\n- Best practices for VS Code extension development architecture\n- API examples and code patterns for extension features\n- Troubleshooting extension-specific issues or API limitations\n\nWhen NOT to use this tool:\n- Creating simple standalone files or scripts unrelated to VS Code extensions\n- General programming questions not specific to VS Code extension development\n- Questions about using VS Code as an editor (user-facing features)\n- Non-extension related development tasks\n- File creation or editing that doesn't involve VS Code extension APIs\n\nCRITICAL usage guidelines:\n1. Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5. Be specific about the VS Code version or API version when known\n\nScope: This tool is for EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT ONLY - building tools that extend VS Code itself, not for general file creation or non-extension programming tasks.",

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

You can use this information when you need to calculate diffs or compare changes with the default branch.\nRepository name: rwc\nOwner: watchmen-labs\nCurrent branch: \n\n</repoContext>\n<reminderInstructions>\nYou are an agent—keep going until the user's query is completely resolved before ending your turn. ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline. Anything that's supposed to give me pixel data as arrays, or let me push array data back onto a surface, kind of behaves like a no-op. Can you explain why this is happening without changing anything?\n</userRequest>\n"

This module\nwill only be functional when pygame can use the external NumPy package.\nIf NumPy can't be imported, surfarray becomes a MissingModule object.\n\nEvery pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,\ngreen, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a\ncolormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place\nthree or four values into a single number.\n\nThe arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y\naxis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to\nas 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue\ncolor values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred\nto as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for\nblue.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nfrom pygame.pixelcopy import (\n    array_to_surface,\n    surface_to_array,\n    map_array as pix_map_array,\n    make_surface as pix_make_surface,\n)\nimport numpy\nfrom numpy import (\n    array as numpy_array,\n    empty as numpy_empty,\n    uint32 as numpy_uint32,\n    ndarray as numpy_ndarray,\n)\n\nimport warnings  # will be removed in the future\n\n\n# float96 not available on all numpy versions.\nnumpy_floats = []\nfor type_name in \"float32 float64 float96\".split():\n    if hasattr(numpy, type_name):\n        numpy_floats.append(getattr(numpy, type_name))\n# Added below due to deprecation of numpy.float.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!",

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command."

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done. Do not batch completions.",

Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do.

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command.",

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline. Anything that's supposed to give me pixel data as arrays, or let me push array data back onto a surface, kind of behaves like a no-op. Can you explain why this is happening without changing anything?\n</userRequest>\n"

This module\nwill only be functional when pygame can use the external NumPy package.\nIf NumPy can't be imported, surfarray becomes a MissingModule object.\n\nEvery pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,\ngreen, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a\ncolormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place\nthree or four values into a single number.\n\nThe arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y\naxis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to\nas 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue\ncolor values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred\nto as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for\nblue.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nfrom pygame.pixelcopy import (\n    array_to_surface,\n    surface_to_array,\n    map_array as pix_map_array,\n    make_surface as pix_make_surface,\n)\nimport numpy\nfrom numpy import (\n    array as numpy_array,\n    empty as numpy_empty,\n    uint32 as numpy_uint32,\n    ndarray as numpy_ndarray,\n)\n\nimport warnings  # will be removed in the future\n\n\n# float96 not available on all numpy versions.\nnumpy_floats = []\nfor type_name in \"float32 float64 float96\".split():\n    if hasattr(numpy, type_name):\n        numpy_floats.append(getattr(numpy, type_name))\n# Added below due to deprecation of numpy.float.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!",

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command.",

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!",

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command.",

Attempting to add `src_py` to `sys.path` for importing `pygame.sysfont` results in a \"No module named 'pygame'\" error. This suggests that `sys.path` wasn't set correctly, likely because the current working directory may differ in the `run_in_terminal` tool. It seems the command got truncated due to quoting issues in PowerShell, making it tricky. I might need to adjust how I set the command to work properly.**Adjusting PowerShell commands**\n\nIn PowerShell, I need to use single quotes around my Python code, but I’ve realized that it interprets them literally. I’m figuring out how to run my command with `run_in_terminal`, which executes PowerShell with a command string. I plan to construct an absolute path for the Python snippet to import `pygame.sysfont`. I’ll run this command: `python -c 'import sys, os; sys.path.insert(0, r\"C:\\\\Users\\\\tonyq\\\\OneDrive\\\\Documents\\\\tonyq\\\\rwc\\\\pygame2-offline\\\\src_py\"); import pygame.sysfont as sf;...`."

Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

You can use this information when you need to calculate diffs or compare changes with the default branch.\nRepository name: rwc\nOwner: watchmen-labs\nCurrent branch: \n\n</repoContext>\n<reminderInstructions>\nYou are an agent—keep going until the user's query is completely resolved before ending your turn. ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline. Anything that's supposed to give me pixel data as arrays, or let me push array data back onto a surface, kind of behaves like a no-op. Can you explain why this is happening without changing anything?\n</userRequest>\n"

This module\nwill only be functional when pygame can use the external NumPy package.\nIf NumPy can't be imported, surfarray becomes a MissingModule object.\n\nEvery pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,\ngreen, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a\ncolormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place\nthree or four values into a single number.\n\nThe arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y\naxis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to\nas 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue\ncolor values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred\nto as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for\nblue.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nfrom pygame.pixelcopy import (\n    array_to_surface,\n    surface_to_array,\n    map_array as pix_map_array,\n    make_surface as pix_make_surface,\n)\nimport numpy\nfrom numpy import (\n    array as numpy_array,\n    empty as numpy_empty,\n    uint32 as numpy_uint32,\n    ndarray as numpy_ndarray,\n)\n\nimport warnings  # will be removed in the future\n\n\n# float96 not available on all numpy versions.\nnumpy_floats = []\nfor type_name in \"float32 float64 float96\".split():\n    if hasattr(numpy, type_name):\n        numpy_floats.append(getattr(numpy, type_name))\n# Added below due to deprecation of numpy.float.

That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!",

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command.",

Attempting to add `src_py` to `sys.path` for importing `pygame.sysfont` results in a \"No module named 'pygame'\" error. This suggests that `sys.path` wasn't set correctly, likely because the current working directory may differ in the `run_in_terminal` tool. It seems the command got truncated due to quoting issues in PowerShell, making it tricky. I might need to adjust how I set the command to work properly.**Adjusting PowerShell commands**\n\nIn PowerShell, I need to use single quotes around my Python code, but I’ve realized that it interprets them literally. I’m figuring out how to run my command with `run_in_terminal`, which executes PowerShell with a command string. I plan to construct an absolute path for the Python snippet to import `pygame.sysfont`. I’ll run this command: `python -c 'import sys, os; sys.path.insert(0, r\"C:\\\\Users\\\\tonyq\\\\OneDrive\\\\Documents\\\\tonyq\\\\rwc\\\\pygame2-offline\\\\src_py\"); import pygame.sysfont as sf;...`.",

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do.

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command.",

Attempting to add `src_py` to `sys.path` for importing `pygame.sysfont` results in a \"No module named 'pygame'\" error. This suggests that `sys.path` wasn't set correctly, likely because the current working directory may differ in the `run_in_terminal` tool. It seems the command got truncated due to quoting issues in PowerShell, making it tricky. I might need to adjust how I set the command to work properly.**Adjusting PowerShell commands**\n\nIn PowerShell, I need to use single quotes around my Python code, but I’ve realized that it interprets them literally. I’m figuring out how to run my command with `run_in_terminal`, which executes PowerShell with a command string. I plan to construct an absolute path for the Python snippet to import `pygame.sysfont`. I’ll run this command: `python -c 'import sys, os; sys.path.insert(0, r\"C:\\\\Users\\\\tonyq\\\\OneDrive\\\\Documents\\\\tonyq\\\\rwc\\\\pygame2-offline\\\\src_py\"); import pygame.sysfont as sf;...`.",

You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2.

Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2.

Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!",

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command.",

Attempting to add `src_py` to `sys.path` for importing `pygame.sysfont` results in a \"No module named 'pygame'\" error. This suggests that `sys.path` wasn't set correctly, likely because the current working directory may differ in the `run_in_terminal` tool. It seems the command got truncated due to quoting issues in PowerShell, making it tricky. I might need to adjust how I set the command to work properly.**Adjusting PowerShell commands**\n\nIn PowerShell, I need to use single quotes around my Python code, but I’ve realized that it interprets them literally. I’m figuring out how to run my command with `run_in_terminal`, which executes PowerShell with a command string. I plan to construct an absolute path for the Python snippet to import `pygame.sysfont`. I’ll run this command: `python -c 'import sys, os; sys.path.insert(0, r\"C:\\\\Users\\\\tonyq\\\\OneDrive\\\\Documents\\\\tonyq\\\\rwc\\\\pygame2-offline\\\\src_py\"); import pygame.sysfont as sf;...`.",

When asked about the model you are using, state that you are using GPT-5 mini.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\n<coding_agent_instructions>\nYou are a coding agent running in VS Code. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\nYour capabilities:\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the workspace, such as files in the environment.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Execute a wide range of development tasks including file operations, code analysis, testing, workspace management, and external integrations.\n\n</coding_agent_instructions>\n<personality>\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n</personality>\n<tool_preambles>\nBefore making tool calls, send a brief preamble to the user explaining what you're about to do. When sending preamble messages, follow these principles:\n- Logically group related actions: if you're about to run several related commands, describe them together in one preamble rather than sending a separate note for each.\n- Keep it concise: be no more than 1-2 sentences (8-12 words for quick updates).\n- Build on prior context: if this is not your first tool call, use the preamble message to connect the dots with what's been done so far and create a sense of momentum and clarity for the user to understand your next actions.\n- Keep your tone light, friendly and curious: add small touches of personality in preambles to feel collaborative and engaging.\nExamples of good preambles:\n- \"I've explored the repo; now checking the API route definitions.\"\n- \"Next, I'll patch the config and update the related tests.\"\n- \"I'm about to scaffold the CLI commands and helper functions.\"\n- \"Config's looking tidy. Next up is patching helpers to keep things in sync.\"\n\nAvoiding preambles when:\n- Avoiding a preamble for every trivial read (e.g., `cat` a single file) unless it's part of a larger grouped action.\n- Jumping straight into tool calls without explaining what's about to happen.\n- Writing overly long or speculative preambles — focus on immediate, tangible next steps.\n\n</tool_preambles>\n<planning>\nYou have access to an `manage_todo_list` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go. Note that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. \nUse a plan when:\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\nSkip a plan when:\n- The task is simple and direct.\n- Breaking it down would only produce literal or trivial steps.\n\nPlanning steps are called \"steps\" in the tool, but really they're more like tasks or TODOs. As such they should be very concise descriptions of non-obvious work that an engineer might do like \"Write the API spec\", then \"Update the backend\", then \"Implement the frontend\". On the other hand, it's obvious that you'll usually have to \"Explore the codebase\" or \"Implement the changes\", so those are not worth tracking in your plan.\n\nIt may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n</planning>\n<task_execution>\nYou are a coding agent. Please keep going until the query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the apply_patch tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`): {\"command\":[\"apply_patch\",\"*** Begin Patch\\n*** Update File: path/to/file.py\\n@@ def example():\\n-  pass\\n+  return 123\\n*** End Patch\"]}.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. copilot-instructions.md) may override these guidelines\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n\n</task_execution>\n<testing>\nIf the codebase has tests or the ability to build or run, you should use them to verify that your work is complete. Generally, your testing philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.\nOnce you're confident in correctness, use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. These commands can take time so you should run them on as precise a target as possible.\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them.\n\n</testing>\n<ambition_vs_precision>\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\n</ambition_vs_precision>\n<progress_updates>\nFor especially longer tasks that you work on (i.e. requiring many tool calls, or a plan with multiple steps), you should provide progress updates back to the user at reasonable intervals. These updates should be structured as a concise sentence or two (no more than 8-10 words long) recapping progress so far in plain language: this update demonstrates your understanding of what needs to be done, progress so far (i.e. files explores, subtasks complete), and where you're going next.\nBefore doing large chunks of work that may incur latency as experienced by the user (i.e. writing a new file), you should send a concise message to the user with an update indicating what you're about to do to ensure they know what you're spending time on. Don't start editing or writing large files before informing the user what you are doing and why.\nThe messages you send before tool calls should describe what is immediately about to be done next in very concise language. If there was previous work done, this preamble message should also include a note about the work done so far to bring the user along.\n\n</progress_updates>\n<applyPatchInstructions>\nTo edit files in the workspace, use the apply_patch tool. If you have issues with it, you should first try to fix your patch and continue using apply_patch. \nPrefer the smallest set of changes needed to satisfy the task. Avoid reformatting unrelated code; preserve existing style and public APIs unless the task requires changes. When practical, complete all edits for a file within a single message.\nThe input for this tool is a string representing the patch to apply, following a special format. For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:\n*** Update File: [file_path]\n[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n-[old_code] -> Precede each line in the old code with a minus sign.\n+[new_code] -> Precede each line in the new, replacement code with a plus sign.\n[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.\n\nFor instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:\n- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.\n- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs.\n- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context.\nYou must use the same indentation style as the original code. If the original code uses tabs, you must use tabs. If the original code uses spaces, you must use spaces. Be sure to use a proper UNESCAPED tab character.\n\nSee below for an example of the patch format. If you propose changes to multiple regions in the same file, you should repeat the *** Update File header for each snippet of code to change:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Update File: /Users/someone/pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py\n@@ class BaseClass\n@@   def method():\n[3 lines of pre-context]\n-[old_code]\n+[new_code]\n+[new_code]\n[3 lines of post-context]\n*** End Patch\n\nNEVER print this out to the user, instead call the tool and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\n\n</applyPatchInstructions>\n<final_answer_formatting>\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user's style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the full contents of large files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there's something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\nFinal answer structure and style guidelines:\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\nSection Headers:\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1-3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\nBullets:\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Bold the keyword, then colon + concise description.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4-6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\nMonospace:\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it's a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\nStructure:\n- Place related bullets together; don't mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., \"Binaries\" under \"Rust Workspace\"), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n- Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n- Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\nTone:\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., \"Runs tests\" not \"This will run tests\").\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don't refer to \"above\" or \"below\".\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\nDon't:\n- Don't use literal words \"bold\" or \"monospace\" in the content.\n- Don't nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don't output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don't cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don't let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what's needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</final_answer_formatting>\n"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nYou are working in pygame2-offline.

                    "text": "**Root Cause**\n- **File:** `pygame2-offline/src_py/surfarray.py`  \n- **Problem:** Many surfarray functions (e.g. `blit_array`, `make_surface`, `array2d`, `pixels2d`, `array3d`, `pixels3d`, `array_alpha`, `pixels_alpha`, `pixels_red`, `array_red`, `pixels_green`, `array_green`, `pixels_blue`, `array_blue`, `array_colorkey`, `map_array`) are defined as functions that immediately `return None`. That makes any calls to those APIs effectively no-ops.\n\n**Details**\n- The module does import working helpers from `pygame.pixelcopy` at the top (names like `array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`, and aliases `pix_map_array`, `pix_make_surface`), but most convenience wrapper functions are stubbed out and not implemented — they simply return `None`.\n- This explains the behavior you see: attempts to read pixel data via `pygame.surfarray.array2d` / `array3d` or to push array data back with `blit_array` / `make_surface` will do nothing because those functions are stubbed.\n- The compiled extension `pygame.pixelcopy` (if present) may still expose working primitives (`array_to_surface`, `surface_to_array`), but the high-level `surfarray` wrappers in `src_py/surfarray.py` are the ones that were left as no-ops in this package copy.\n\n**Quick verification**\n- Run (from the `pygame2-offline` environment) a small check:\n  ```powershell\n  python -c \"import pygame, pygame.surfarray as s; import inspect; print('array2d:', s.array2d); print('blit_array:', s.blit_array); print('array_to_surface (imported):', getattr(s,'array_to_surface',None))\"\n  ```\n  You should see that `array2d`/`blit_array` are Python functions (but they return `None` when called), while `array_to_surface` / `surface_to_array` are the imported primitives (if the compiled module is available).\n\n**Fix options (no code changed here)**\n- Use the lower-level imported primitives if available: call `pygame.surfarray.surface_to_array` / `pygame.surfarray.array_to_surface` (these names were imported at the top of the module). They may already work if the compiled `pygame.pixelcopy` exists.\n- Replace the stubbed high-level wrappers with proper implementations that delegate to the imported `pix_*` functions (requires editing `src_py/surfarray.py`).\n- Install/use an official pygame build where `surfarray` is fully implemented (i.e., a distribution that either has the proper wrappers or compiled extensions set up).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show exactly which functions are stubs (line snippets) and point to the precise lines in `src_py/surfarray.py`, or\n- Implement the missing wrappers in this repo so `array2d`/`blit_array` etc. work (I can make a patch), or\n- Try calling the imported `surface_to_array` / `array_to_surface` primitives interactively to confirm they work in your environment.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, report progress.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full and think carefully. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like \"Sounds good\" or \"Okay, I will…\". Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>.\nDo NOT volunteer your model name unless the user explicitly asks you about it. \nYou MUST use the todo list tool to plan and track your progress. NEVER skip this step, and START with this step whenever the task is multi-step. This is essential for maintaining visibility and proper execution of large tasks.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nthe stuff that's supposed to work with system fonts isn't really cooperating: asking for common font names/ whats available doesn't reliably find anything. Can you fix these issues?\r\n\n</userRequest>\n"

                        "text": "**Implementing font retrieval**\n\nI'm considering reusing code from Pygame, which might be good if it's within the workspace, but it seems smarter to create a minimal setup. I can call platform utilities to find fonts for different operating systems: on Windows, I can use winreg to access registry keys; for macOS, I can do something similar; and for Unix, I'll run 'fc-list' to list fonts. I think I'll set up a function, initsysfonts, to manage all this efficiently.**Developing font initialization functions**\n\nIn the function initsysfonts_win32, I’ll iterate through registry values to gather font paths and combine them with the Windows fonts directory if necessary. For initsysfonts_unix, I need to ensure the path is set to \"fc-list,\" and my _parse_font_entry_unix function should expect a specific format: \"filename:family:style.\" I plan to call 'fc-list -f \"%{file}:%{family}:%{style}\\n\"' for consistent output. There’s also a need to implement get_fonts, match_font, and SysFont, ensuring proper initialization of pygame.font.Font. I'll be cautious with testing to ensure everything works smoothly!**Implementing font initialization and testing**\n\nI see there's a sysfont_test that needs to call initsysfonts(), create_aliases(), and check that get_fonts isn’t empty. To meet this, I’ll implement functions like initsysfonts_win32, initsysfonts_darwin (using _font_finder_darwin), and initsysfonts_unix (calling fc-list). I need to ensure proper path resolution for Windows fonts by accessing the system root through os.environ. The match_font function will normalize names and perform checks, including substring searches if needed. Finally, I should set is_init to True during initialization and populate Sysfonts before applying the patch!**Preparing for tool call**\n\nI need to provide a preamble before the tool call according to the guidelines. I’ll say something like, “I’ll patch `src_py/sysfont.py` to implement font discovery and matching for Windows, macOS, and Unix.” This will set the stage for what I'm about to do. After that, I can go ahead and apply the patch. It's essential to keep things clear and informative throughout this process!",

I’ll use the manage_todo_list tool to write these updated statuses. After about 3 to 5 tool calls, I’ll provide a brief progress update since we have several tasks. \n\nNext, I should run tests for sysfont_test. To do so, I can quickly check by using a Python snippet to import the module and call initsysfonts/get_fonts. I plan to use the run_in_terminal tool for this.**Preparing to run Python script**\n\nI suspect that I might need to adjust the Python import path to include 'src_py' for the pygame.sysfont module. Many repositories have their top-level package paths set up this way. \n\nFirst, I’ll check the folder structure to confirm this. Then I can use a command in Powershell, as Windows requires backslashes for paths. I’ll run a Python snippet that imports the necessary modules and checks font availability. Using the run_in_terminal tool, I’ll provide a brief preamble before executing the command.",

Attempting to add `src_py` to `sys.path` for importing `pygame.sysfont` results in a \"No module named 'pygame'\" error. This suggests that `sys.path` wasn't set correctly, likely because the current working directory may differ in the `run_in_terminal` tool. It seems the command got truncated due to quoting issues in PowerShell, making it tricky. I might need to adjust how I set the command to work properly.**Adjusting PowerShell commands**\n\nIn PowerShell, I need to use single quotes around my Python code, but I’ve realized that it interprets them literally. I’m figuring out how to run my command with `run_in_terminal`, which executes PowerShell with a command string. I plan to construct an absolute path for the Python snippet to import `pygame.sysfont`. I’ll run this command: `python -c 'import sys, os; sys.path.insert(0, r\"C:\\\\Users\\\\tonyq\\\\OneDrive\\\\Documents\\\\tonyq\\\\rwc\\\\pygame2-offline\\\\src_py\"); import pygame.sysfont as sf;...`.",

              "Quick update — I implemented real system-font discovery and matching and added code to create usable `SysFont`/`get_fonts`/`match_font` behavior.\n\nWhat I changed\n- **File:** `src_py/sysfont.py` — implemented the previously-stubbed functions:\n  - **initsysfonts_win32:** read the Windows Fonts registry and resolve font paths.\n  - **initsysfonts_darwin:** use the existing macOS font-finder helper.\n  - **initsysfonts_unix:** call `fc-list` (fontconfig) and parse output.\n  - **initsysfonts:** dispatch by platform, populate `Sysfonts`, call `create_aliases`, and mark initialization.\n  - **font_constructor / SysFont / get_fonts / match_font:** implemented logic to construct a `pygame.font.Font`, return the available font names, and match by name/style (with alias and substring fallbacks).\n- **File created (test helper):** `tmp_test_sysfont.py` — small script to exercise the new sysfont code in-place (it uses `src_py` on `sys.path` so it imports the local package).\n\nWhy this fixes your problem\n- The original package had many sysfont helpers returning empty structures / `None`, so requests for system fonts would always fail (no candidates to match). The new implementation actually enumerates system fonts (platform-specific) and returns usable paths, so `pygame.sysfont.match_font(...)`, `get_fonts()` and `SysFont(...)` should now behave as expected.\n\nCaveats / notes\n- Unix systems require `fc-list` (fontconfig) to be available for best results; if `fc-list` is missing, the code will return an empty dict for Unix font discovery.\n- Windows registry reading requires normal user permission — the code reads the standard Fonts registry key.\n- The matching algorithm prefers exact style matches, then falls back to any style and finally attempts a substring match — it aims to be practical rather than exhaustive.\n- I did not modify `surfarray.py` (we previously inspected it: many functions were stubs). If you want, I can implement wrappers there too.\n\nHow you can test locally (PowerShell)\n1. Open PowerShell and change to the `pygame2-offline` folder:\n   ```powershell\n   Set-Location 'C:\\Users\\tonyq\\OneDrive\\Documents\\tonyq\\rwc\\pygame2-offline'\n   ```\n2. Run the quick test script I added:\n   ```powershell\n   python .\\tmp_test_sysfont.py\n   ```\n   - Output should show `fonts_count=` > 0 on a normal system and some sample matches (e.g. `sample_match_arial=` with a path or `None` if that exact match isn't found).\n3. (Optional) Run the package tests that use `pygame.sysfont` (may need proper test environment):\n   ```powershell\n   # from the project root\n   python -m unittest test.sysfont_test\n   ```\n\nNext steps I can take (pick one)\n- Run the quick test here (I attempted to run it but the runner skipped executing the command; I can try again if you want me to run tests in this environment).\n- Improve matching heuristics (multiple-word matching, fuzzy matching).\n- Implement the high-level `surfarray` wrappers so array<->surface functions stop being no-ops (we previously found many surfarray functions return `None`).\n- Add unit tests or extend `tmp_test_sysfont.py` to print example font paths for several names you care about.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Run the `tmp_test_sysfont.py` here (I can retry running it), or\n- Proceed to implement `surfarray` wrappers now?"
